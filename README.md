# nineideas frontend README

[**nineideas.net**](https://nineideas.net/) is a minimalist social network and micro-blogging platform that encourages users to develop a habit of coming up with new ideas each day. The goal is to maintain a daily streak of developing nine ideas on a new topic every day.

This repo is the frontend of a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application. The backend API is a separate repo: https://github.com/josephrmartinez/nineideasapi
