    - Add click event to each list -> navigate to viewList page
    - Implement pending style on NavLink
    
- Implement display lists in viewUser page USING REACT ROUTER LOADERS!
    - Styling

    - Place filler content so that loading delay does not cause content shift (this should not be needed if I implement ReactRouter correctly and page content loads BEFORE the page is displayed)

    - Add click event on each list -> navigate to view list page OR addList page if draft
    - Implement update bio functionality
